# Empowering the Nation - Website

A responsive educational website for skills training and professional development courses in South Africa.

## Project Overview

The **Empowering the Nation Website** is a modern, responsive platform created to inform and engage learners interested in short courses and 6-month learnership programs offered to domestic workers and gardeners across South Africa.  

It mirrors the structure and design of the Empowering the Nation Android Application but focuses on **web accessibility**, providing intuitive navigation, interactive course listings, and a real-time fee calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
